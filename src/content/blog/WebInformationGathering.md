# Web Reconnaissance Guide

## 1. Overview of Web Reconnaissance

- **Definition**: Web reconnaissance is the preliminary phase of a security assessment, focusing on systematically gathering information about a target website or web application to understand its structure and potential weaknesses.
- **Objectives**:
  - **Asset Discovery**: Identify public-facing elements such as web pages, subdomains, IP addresses, and technologies in use.
  - **Uncover Sensitive Data**: Detect exposed information like configuration files or backup data.
  - **Map Attack Surface**: Pinpoint vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or entry points for potential exploitation.
  - **Gather Intelligence**: Collect data for social engineering, such as key personnel details or email addresses.
- **Significance**:
  - Attackers leverage reconnaissance to craft targeted attacks and evade defenses.
  - Defenders use it to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Reconnaissance Types**:
  - **Active Reconnaissance**:
    - Involves direct interaction with the target (e.g., scanning ports or vulnerabilities).
    - Techniques: Port scanning, vulnerability scanning, network mapping, banner grabbing, OS fingerprinting, service enumeration, web crawling.
    - Tools: Nmap, Nessus, Nikto, Burp Suite Spider, curl.
    - Risk: High chance of detection due to triggering intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewalls.
  - **Passive Reconnaissance**:
    - Relies on publicly available data without direct target interaction.
    - Techniques: Search engine queries, WHOIS lookups, DNS analysis, web archive reviews, social media scraping, code repository analysis.
    - Tools: Google, WHOIS CLI, dig, Wayback Machine, LinkedIn, GitHub.
    - Risk: Minimal detection risk, as it resembles typical internet activity.

## 2. WHOIS Protocol

- **Definition**: WHOIS is a query/response protocol used to retrieve registration details for internet resources like domains, IP addresses, and autonomous systems from public databases.
- **Purpose**: Acts as the internet’s directory, providing ownership and technical details for online assets.
- **Key WHOIS Record Elements**:
  - **Domain Name**: e.g., `example.com`.
  - **Registrar**: The entity managing the domain (e.g., GoDaddy).
  - **Registrant Contact**: The domain owner (individual or organization).
  - **Administrative Contact**: Manages domain operations.
  - **Technical Contact**: Handles technical configurations.
  - **Creation/Expiration Dates**: Registration and expiry dates.
  - **Name Servers**: Resolve domain to IP addresses.
- **Historical Context**:
  - Developed in the 1970s by Elizabeth Feinler at Stanford’s NIC for ARPANET.
  - Originally tracked network users, hostnames, and domains.
- **Relevance to Reconnaissance**:
  - **Personnel Insights**: Exposes names, emails, or phone numbers for social engineering or phishing.
  - **Infrastructure Mapping**: Name servers and IPs reveal hosting providers or misconfigurations.
  - **Historical Analysis**: Tools like WhoisFreaks track changes in ownership or configurations.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Phishing Detection**:
    - A WHOIS lookup on a suspicious email domain reveals recent registration, hidden ownership, or shady hosting, indicating phishing.
    - Action: Block the domain, alert users, investigate the hosting provider.
  - **Malware Investigation**:
    - A malware C2 server’s WHOIS shows anonymous emails, high-risk hosting countries, or lax registrars, suggesting a compromised server.
    - Action: Notify the provider, escalate investigation.
  - **Threat Intelligence**:
    - Analyzing WHOIS data across threat actor domains uncovers patterns like clustered registrations or shared name servers.
    - Action: Develop threat profiles, share indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **Using WHOIS**:
  - **Installation**: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install whois -y` (Linux).
  - **Command**: `whois example.com` (e.g., `whois google.com`).
  - **Sample Output (google.com)**:
    - **Registrar**: MarkMonitor Inc.
    - **Creation Date**: 1997-09-15.
    - **Expiry Date**: 2028-09-14.
    - **Registrant**: Google LLC, Domain Admin.
    - **Domain Status**: Protected (clientDeleteProhibited, clientTransferProhibited).
    - **Name Servers**: `ns1.google.com`, `ns2.google.com`, etc.
    - **Insight**: Well-secured, long-standing domain with Google-managed DNS.
  - **Limitations**: May not reveal specific vulnerabilities or employee details; supplement with other recon methods.

## 3. Domain Name System (DNS)

- **Definition**: DNS translates user-friendly domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses (e.g., 93.184.216.34), serving as the internet’s navigation system.
- **DNS Resolution Process**:
  1. **Query Initiation**: A device checks its cache, then queries a DNS resolver (e.g., ISP server).
  2. **Recursive Query**: Resolver contacts a root name server.
  3. **Root Response**: Directs to a top-level domain (TLD) server (e.g., `.com`).
  4. **TLD Response**: Points to the authoritative name server.
  5. **Authoritative Response**: Provides the IP address.
  6. **Resolver Delivery**: Returns the IP to the device and caches it.
  7. **Connection**: Device connects to the target server.
- **Hosts File**:
  - Location: `/etc/hosts` (Linux/macOS), `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (Windows).
  - Format: `<IP> <Hostname> [<Alias>]` (e.g., `127.0.0.1 localhost`).
  - Purpose: Local DNS overrides for testing, development, or blocking (e.g., `0.0.0.0 ads.example.com`).
  - Editing: Requires admin/root access; changes are immediate.
- **Core DNS Concepts**:
  - **Zone**: A managed segment of a domain’s namespace (e.g., `example.com` and its subdomains).
  - **Zone File**: Contains resource records for a zone (e.g., A, MX, NS).
  - **DNS Record Types**:
    - **A**: Links hostname to IPv4 (e.g., `www.example.com IN A 93.184.216.34`).
    - **AAAA**: Links hostname to IPv6.
    - **CNAME**: Aliases a hostname to another (e.g., `blog.example.com IN CNAME server1.example.net`).
    - **MX**: Defines mail servers (e.g., `example.com IN MX 10 mail.example.com`).
    - **NS**: Lists authoritative name servers.
    - **TXT**: Stores arbitrary text (e.g., SPF records).
    - **SOA**: Specifies zone authority (e.g., serial number, refresh intervals).
    - **SRV**: Indicates service locations.
    - **PTR**: Maps IP to hostname for reverse DNS.
  - **IN**: Denotes Internet protocol in records.
- **Reconnaissance Value**:
  - **Asset Identification**: Reveals subdomains, mail servers, and hosting infrastructure.
  - **Infrastructure Mapping**: NS/A records pinpoint hosting providers or load balancers.
  - **Change Monitoring**: New subdomains (e.g., `api.example.com`) or TXT records (e.g., security tools) signal new services or vulnerabilities.
- **Sample Zone File**:
  ```plaintext
  $TTL 3600
  @ IN SOA ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (2025010101 3600 900 604800 86400)
  @ IN NS ns1.example.com.
  @ IN NS ns2.example.com.
  @ IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
  www IN A 93.184.216.34
  mail IN A 198.51.100.10
  ftp IN CNAME www.example.com.
  ```

## 5. Advanced Reconnaissance: Subdomains, Zone Transfers, Virtual Hosts, and Certificate Transparency

### 5.1 Subdomains

- **Definition**: Subdomains are extensions of a primary domain (e.g., `app.example.com` for `example.com`), used to segment services like email, blogs, or admin portals.
- **Reconnaissance Value**:
  - **Development Environments**: Subdomains like `staging.example.com` may be less secure, exposing sensitive data.
  - **Administrative Portals**: Hidden subdomains (e.g., `admin.example.com`) may host login interfaces.
  - **Legacy Systems**: Forgotten subdomains may run outdated, exploitable software.
  - **Data Exposure**: Misconfigured subdomains may leak configurations or internal documents.
- **Enumeration Methods**:
  - **Active Enumeration**:
    - Directly queries target DNS servers.
    - Techniques:
      - **Zone Transfers**: Attempts to retrieve the full zone file (rarely successful due to modern security).
      - **Brute-Forcing**: Tests subdomain names using wordlists.
    - Tools: `dnsenum`, `fierce`, `gobuster`.
    - Risk: Detectable by security systems.
  - **Passive Enumeration**:
    - Leverages external data sources without contacting the target.
    - Techniques:
      - **Certificate Transparency Logs**: Public SSL certificate records reveal subdomains.
      - **Search Engines**: Queries like `site:*.example.com` uncover subdomains.
      - **DNS Databases**: Aggregate historical DNS data.
    - Risk: Low detection risk, highly stealthy.
  - **Best Practice**: Combine active and passive techniques for thorough coverage.

---

### 5.2 Subdomain Brute-Forcing

- **Definition**: An active method that tests potential subdomain names against a domain using wordlists to identify valid subdomains.
- **Workflow**:
  1. **Select Wordlist**:
     - **Generic**: Common terms (e.g., `dev`, `mail`, `admin`).
     - **Targeted**: Industry-specific or based on observed naming conventions.
     - **Custom**: Derived from recon data or keywords.
  2. **Query Execution**: Tool appends wordlist entries to the domain (e.g., `test.example.com`).
  3. **DNS Resolution**: Verifies if subdomains resolve to IPs via A/AAAA records.
  4. **Validation**: Filters results, optionally checks accessibility.
- **Tools**:
  - **dnsenum**: Multifaceted DNS recon with brute-forcing, zone transfers, and WHOIS lookups.
  - **fierce**: Streamlined for subdomain discovery with wildcard detection.
  - **dnsrecon**, **amass**, **assetfinder**, **puredns**: Specialized for efficient subdomain enumeration.
- **Example (dnsenum)**:
  ```bash
  dnsenum --enum example.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt
  ```
  - Output: Identifies `www.example.com`, `mail.example.com` resolving to `93.184.216.34`.
  - Features: Recursive brute-forcing, DNS record enumeration, leverages SecLists.
- **Considerations**:
  - Generates noticeable DNS traffic; may trigger alerts.
  - Use focused wordlists to minimize noise and improve accuracy.

---

### 5.3 DNS Zone Transfers

- **Definition**: A process for syncing DNS records between primary and secondary name servers to ensure consistency.
- **Mechanism**:
  1. **AXFR Request**: Secondary server requests a full zone transfer (AXFR).
  2. **SOA Delivery**: Primary sends the Start of Authority record.
  3. **Record Transfer**: Sends all records (A, MX, NS, etc.).
  4. **Completion**: Primary signals transfer completion.
  5. **Confirmation**: Secondary acknowledges receipt.
- **Security Risk**:
  - Misconfigured servers may allow unauthorized AXFR requests, exposing the entire zone file.
  - Exposed Data: Subdomains, IPs, mail servers, hosting details, and misconfigurations.
  - Historical Note: Common in the early internet; now rare but misconfigurations persist.
- **Exploitation Example**:
  - Tool: `dig`.
  - Command:
    ```bash
    dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
    ```
  - Output (zonetransfer.me):
    ```plaintext
    zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN SOA nsztm1.digi.ninja. robin.digi.ninja. ...
    zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A 5.196.105.14
    zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN MX 0 ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
    www.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A 5.196.105.14
    internal.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A 127.0.0.1
    ...
    ```
  - Insight: Exposes subdomains (`internal.zonetransfer.me`), IPs, and mail servers.
  - Note: `zonetransfer.me` is a test domain for educational purposes.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Limit zone transfers to authorized secondary servers.
  - Regularly audit DNS configurations.
- **Recon Value**:
  - Provides a complete DNS infrastructure map.
  - Uncovers hidden subdomains (e.g., internal or staging servers).
  - Even failed transfers reveal configuration details.

---

### 5.4 Virtual Hosts (VHosts)

- **Definition**: Virtual hosts enable multiple websites or domains to operate on a single server or IP, differentiated by the HTTP Host header.
- **VHosts vs. Subdomains**:
  - **Subdomains**: Managed via DNS records (e.g., `blog.example.com`).
  - **VHosts**: Server-side configurations, may not have DNS entries.
  - Example (Apache):
    ```plaintext
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName www.example.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/example
    </VirtualHost>
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName app.example.org
        DocumentRoot /var/www/app
    </VirtualHost>
    ```
- **Operation**:
  1. Browser sends an HTTP request with a Host header (e.g., `app.example.com`).
  2. Server matches the Host header to a VHost configuration.
  3. Serves content from the corresponding document root.
- **Accessing Undocumented VHosts**:
  - Edit the local hosts file (e.g., `/etc/hosts` or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`).
  - Example: `93.184.216.34 hidden.example.com` to bypass DNS.
- **Virtual Hosting Types**:
  - **Name-Based**: Relies on Host header; efficient, widely used, but limited for some protocols (e.g., older SSL).
  - **IP-Based**: Assigns unique IPs per site; flexible but IP-intensive.
  - **Port-Based**: Uses different ports (e.g., `:8080`); less common due to user inconvenience.
- **VHost Discovery (Fuzzing)**:
  - Technique: Tests various hostnames against a server’s IP to identify active VHosts.
  - Tool: **Gobuster**.
  - Command:
    ```bash
    gobuster vhost -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain
    ```
  - Output: Discovers `app.example.com` (Status: 200).
  - Flags:
    - `-u`: Target URL or IP.
    - `-w`: Wordlist path.
    - `--append-domain`: Adds base domain to queries.
    - `-t`: Adjusts thread count for speed.
    - `-k`: Skips SSL verification.
    - `-o`: Exports results to a file.
- **Considerations**:
  - Generates significant HTTP traffic; may trigger WAF/IDS.
  - Requires explicit authorization to avoid legal issues.
  - Review results for hidden portals or internal systems.

# Advanced Web Reconnaissance Guide

## 5. Certificate Transparency (CT) Logs

- **Definition**: Certificate Transparency logs are public, tamper-proof records of SSL/TLS certificate issuances, maintained by independent entities to ensure transparency.
- **Purpose**:
  - **Identify Unauthorized Certificates**: Detect rogue or misissued certificates.
  - **Ensure CA Accountability**: Monitor certificate authorities for improper practices.
  - **Enhance Web Security**: Strengthen trust in the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
- **Reconnaissance Value**:
  - Exposes subdomains listed in certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN) fields.
  - Reveals historical or expired subdomains (e.g., forgotten development servers).
  - Offers reliable subdomain discovery without relying on brute-forcing or wordlists.
- **Tools**:
  - **crt.sh**:
    - Web-based platform and API for querying certificate data.
    - Pros: Free, no signup required, intuitive interface.
    - Cons: Basic filtering capabilities.
  - **Censys**:
    - Comprehensive platform for certificate and device discovery.
    - Pros: Rich dataset, API support.
    - Cons: Requires account (free tier available).
- **Example (crt.sh)**:
  ```bash
  curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=example.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[] | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value' | sort -u
  ```
  - **Output**: `dev.example.com`, `secure.dev.example.com`, `.dev.example.com`.
  - **Breakdown**:
    - `curl`: Retrieves JSON data from crt.sh for `example.com`.
    - `jq`: Filters subdomains containing “dev” in `name_value`, extracts unique entries.
    - `sort -u`: Sorts and removes duplicates.
- **Advantages**:
  - Passive and stealthy; no direct interaction with the target.
  - Uncovers obscure or historical subdomains missed by other methods.

---

## Practical Reconnaissance Strategies

- **Comprehensive Approach**:
  - Use **zone transfers** (if misconfigured) for complete DNS insights, **brute-forcing** for active subdomain discovery, **CT logs** for passive enumeration, and **VHost fuzzing** to identify server-side configurations.
- **Stealth Techniques**:
  - Prioritize passive methods like CT logs and search engine queries to avoid detection.
  - For active methods, use targeted wordlists and rate-limited queries to minimize noise.
- **Tool Integration**:
  - Leverage `dig` for zone transfers, `dnsenum` or `gobuster` for brute-forcing, and `crt.sh` for CT log analysis.
  - Automate data extraction with scripts (e.g., `curl` and `jq` for CT logs).
- **Validation**:
  - Verify discovered subdomains and VHosts with HTTP requests or manual inspection.
  - Investigate anomalies, such as development servers or internal portals.
- **Ethical Guidelines**:
  - Obtain explicit permission before performing active reconnaissance (e.g., brute-forcing, VHost fuzzing, zone transfer attempts).
  - Adhere to rate limits to prevent server disruption.
- **Continuous Monitoring**:
  - Regularly query CT logs for newly issued certificates and subdomains.
  - Track DNS changes (e.g., via historical zone transfer data, if available).

      - Headers: Missing `Content-Security-Policy`.
      - Issues: Potential Drupal vulnerabilities, insecure headers.
- **Considerations**:
  - WAFs may block aggressive probes; use subtle techniques.
  - Combine fingerprinting with crawling for contextual insights.

---

### 6.2 Web Crawling

- **Definition**: An automated process (spidering) that systematically navigates a website by following links to collect data like pages, files, and metadata.
- **Process**:
  1. Begin with a seed URL (e.g., homepage).
  2. Fetch and parse the page, extracting links.
  3. Queue and crawl links iteratively.
- **Crawling Approaches**:
  - **Breadth-First**: Explores all links on a page before diving deeper; ideal for mapping site structure.
  - **Depth-First**: Pursues one link path deeply; suited for targeting specific content.
- **Collected Data**:
  - **Links**: Internal (site hierarchy) and external (third-party connections).
  - **Comments**: May reveal sensitive details (e.g., developer notes, software versions).
  - **Metadata**: Includes titles, descriptions, keywords, or authorship.
  - **Sensitive Files**: Configs (`config.php`), backups (`.bak`), logs (`access.log`), or credentials.
- **Reconnaissance Value**:
  - Maps site architecture and uncovers hidden pages.
  - Identifies exploitable files or comments.
  - Enables contextual analysis (e.g., linking comments to exposed directories).
- **Example**:
  - Crawling reveals `/backups/` with directory listing enabled, exposing `database.sql`.
  - A comment referencing “legacy API” combined with `/api/` discovery suggests outdated endpoints.
- **Considerations**:
  - Analyze findings holistically to connect data points.
  - Avoid server overload by limiting request rates.
